# ADR-0001: Dual Controller Frameworks (library-go + controller-runtime)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-02-01 (IstioCSR era; TrustManager extended 2026-03)  
**Deciders**: cert-manager-operator maintainers

## Context

Core CertManager operand management was built on OpenShift **library-go** (`staticresourcecontroller`, `deploymentcontroller`, `OperatorClient` / `OperatorStatus`). Newer optional operands (IstioCSR, TrustManager) were added as feature-gated controllers on a unified **controller-runtime** manager (`pkg/operator/setup_manager.go`) with custom `ConditionalStatus`.

Migrating CertManager off library-go was not required for shipping optional operands; mixing frameworks avoids a large rewrite while allowing modern ctrl-runtime patterns for new CRDs.

## Decision

Keep **library-go** for CertManager (always-on). Use **controller-runtime** for IstioCSR and TrustManager, started when each gate's **resolved** value is enabled (`--unsupported-addon-features` / defaults — IstioCSR GA default true; TrustManager TechPreview default false).

## Consequences

**Positive**:
- Incremental delivery of IstioCSR/TrustManager without rewriting CertManager.
- Shared ctrl-runtime helpers in `pkg/controller/common` (errors, status, client retry).

**Negative / Trade-offs**:
- Agents and contributors must not assume one framework or apply method.
- Two status models (`OperatorStatus` vs `ConditionalStatus`).
- Duplicate concepts (deployment overrides, image env) expressed differently per stack.

## Alternatives Considered

- Rewrite CertManager on controller-runtime — high risk / deferred.
- Pure library-go for optional operands — poorer fit for multi-watch CR-centric install pipelines.

## SME Review Recommended

Rationale for not unifying frameworks long-term; any timeline to migrate CertManager or IstioCSR apply style.
